# Watch

**(WIP)** A custom motion for the Casio F-91W wrist watch.

While the Casio F-91W is a legendary watch, it doesn't keep time all that well.
Whilst it does boast an impressive 7 year battery life, Casio rates it's
accuracy at ±30 seconds time drift per month. This project aims to design a
replacement PCB for the F-91W which is programmable and temperature
compensated, whilst still retaining a reasonable battery life.

The key goals are:

- \< ±10 seconds of time drift per year
- \> 1 year battery life on a CR2016
